# File line counter
The showing code is an example of how to get the number of lines of code that aren't comments and/or empty lines.

## How does it work?
In this case, the file ```service.js``` will be read and its jump lines will be removed so we can work with a cleaner code.<br />
Then, this cleaner code will be looped and a counter will increase everytime there's a valid line of code.
